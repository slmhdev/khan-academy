# khan-academy
Decided to do a fun and beneficial challenge for 2026! This repository will track my progress working through the math lessons on Khan Academy, starting from the fundamentals (literally Pre-K) to College level.

---

The main goal is to get comfortable with math again (algebra, probability, discrete math, etc.) and make programming, CS, and blockchain concepts feel less foreign.

## About Repo
- A record of math topics studied on Khan Academy
- Notes on what I understood, what didn’t, and what needs review
- A way to stay accountable to steady progress

---

## How Notes Will Be Documented
- Progress through Khan Academy lessons in order | Pre-K to College level
- Write brief notes or reflections as needed (including images)

## Status
Active and ongoing.
